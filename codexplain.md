This is a simple chatbot application using the Tkinter library in Python. Here's a breakdown of the code:

# import tkinter as tk
This line imports the Tkinter library, which is used for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Python.


# class ChatbotApp:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = tk.Tk()
        self.root.title("Oceaneyes Chatbot")
This code creates a new class called ChatbotApp and defines its __init__ method, which is called when a new instance of the class is created. The __init__ method creates a new Tkinter window with the title "Oceaneyes Chatbot".


       self.display = tk.Text(self.root, height=20, width=80)
        self.display.pack()
This code creates a new text widget called display that will be used to display the chat history. The pack method is used to add the widget to the window.


        self.user_input = tk.Entry(self.root, width=40)
        self.user_input.pack()
This code creates a new entry widget called user_input that will be used for the user to enter their messages. The pack method is used to add the widget to the window.


        self.send_button = tk.Button(self.root, text="Send", command=self.process_user_input)
        self.send_button.pack()
This code creates a new button widget called send_button that will be used to send the user's message to the chatbot. The command parameter is set to the process_user_input method, which will be called when the button is clicked. The pack method is used to add the widget to the window.


        self.display.insert(tk.END, "Chatbot: Hello! How can I assist you today?\n")
This code inserts a welcome message from the chatbot into the display widget.


    def process_user_input(self):
        user_message = self.user_input.get()
        self.display.insert(tk.END, f"User: {user_message}\n")
        chatbot_response = self.get_chatbot_response(user_message)
        self.display.insert(tk.END, f"Chatbot: {chatbot_response}\n")
        self.user_input.delete(0, tk.END)
This code defines the process_user_input method, which is called when the send_button is clicked. The method gets the user's message from the user_input widget, inserts it into the display widget, generates a response from the chatbot using the get_chatbot_response method (which is not defined in this code), inserts the chatbot's response into the display widget, and clears the user_input widget.

Overall, this code creates a simple chatbot application with a graphical user interface that allows the user to enter messages and receive responses from the chatbot.
