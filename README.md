This code defines a simple chatbot using the Tkinter library in Python.
# Here's a breakdown of the code:

The Chatbot class is defined, which inherits from the tk.Tk class of the Tkinter library.
In the __init__ method, the basic UI elements are created, such as a text area to display the conversation (self.display), an input field for the user to enter their message (self.user_input), and a button to send the message (self.send_button).

The insert method is used to add text to the self.display text area. The tk.END argument specifies that the text should be added to the end of the text area.
The process_user_input method is called when the user clicks the "Send" button. It retrieves the user's message from the self.user_input field, adds it to the self.display text area, generates a response from the chatbot using the get_chatbot_response method, and adds the chatbot's response to the self.display text area. Finally, it clears the self.user_input field.
The get_chatbot_response method takes the user's message as input and returns a response based on predefined rules. If the user's message contains certain keywords (e.g. "hello", "what is your name", "write a joke", "describe yourself", "bye"), the chatbot will respond with a corresponding message. If the user's message doesn't contain any of these keywords, the chatbot will respond with a default message ("sorry, I didn't understand. Could you please rephrase your query?").
The run method starts the Tkinter event loop by calling the mainloop method of the self.root object.
Overall, this code creates a simple chatbot that can respond to a few predefined commands and provides a basic UI for users to interact with the chatbot.

# Implementation :
setup python compiler on your code editor
then paste my code
run it


you  can give these commands to my chatbot as it is a basic chatbot using if else
hello
what is your name
write a joke
describe yourself
bye

try  giving your own commands and share with me.


thank you for reading.
